## Description
Youtube-dl WebUI is a small web interface for youtube-dl. It allows you to host your own video downloader. 
After the download you can stream your videos from your web browser or save it on your computer directly from the list page.
It supports simultaneous downloads in background.

### You can now extract the audio of a video and download multiple videos at the same time !

## Requirements
- A web server (Apache or nginx)
- PHP latest version should be fine.
- Python 2.7 for Youtube-dl
- [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)
- avconv or other is required for audio extraction (from youtube-dl doc) :
`-x, --extract-audio convert video files to audio-only files (requires ffmpeg or avconv and ffprobe or avprobe)`

## How to install ?
1. Clone this repo in your web folder (ex: /var/www).
2. Edit config.php as you want it to work.
3. Create the "videos" folder. 
4. Check permissions.
5. Load index.php to check that everything works.

## Set a password
1. Open config/config.php
2. Set security to true
3. Find a password, hash it with md5 and replace the value of password.

## Troubleshooting
1. If you don't want a password set `security` to false
2. If you have problems downloading files, check the permissions and try setting `indirect_download` to true

Example (chosen password is root):

```
echo -n root|md5sum| sed 's/ .*//'
# Returns the hash 63a9f0ea7bb98050796b649e85481845
```
